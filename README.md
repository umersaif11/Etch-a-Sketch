# Etch-a-Sketch
A Project making square grid between 2-100 size limit depending upon user's requirement and then grid's box change it's color when you move cursor inside the box. This project can be used to make sketch and made for polishing Javascript DOM and Flexbox skills.

EDIT: I don't know why but this project is working fine on all browsers except firefox. Also open
it using dsktop/latop as it is not being responsive yet.
